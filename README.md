## Tips & Best Practices  
1. **Keep it concise:** Aim for 200–300 lines—readers skim; make each word count :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.  
2. **Use sections & emojis:** Improves scannability and conveys personality :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.  
3. **Show, don’t tell:** Include GIFs/screenshots of your demos, and link to live apps if available :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.  
4. **Keep up to date:** Regularly add new publications and projects as your PhD progresses.
